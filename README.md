Subdivx Finder Webapp
=======

Subdivx is a Spanish subtitle site. The search on that page could be little hard and maybe you don't find what you need easily. With this tool, you will have your own webpage with an implementation of a subdivx "service". Doing Scrapping on the page as a service, I provide all the results without paging.

<h1>Setup</h1>
